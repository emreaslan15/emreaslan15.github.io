# Welcome to my website!

Hello, I'm a UK-based Computer Science student currently in my second year interested in both hardware and software.

## Previous Projects
### [CRM Solution in Java (First Year Coursework)](https://github.com/emreaslan15/crm-coursework)
For my first-year university coursework, I wrote a basic CRM solution application in Java that supports saving and loading customers, adding and viewing customer notes, as well as logging communication events.

### [Grid Conquest: Clash! (A-Level NEA)](https://github.com/emreaslan15/gridconquest-clash)
As part of my A-Level studies, I made a text-based game heavily inspired by Fire Emblem by Intelligent Systems for Nintendo consoles. Features include multiplayer, mods (including automatic unique maps using 'extras.py', custom units, weapons, and items), and security for said mods via basic hashing.
